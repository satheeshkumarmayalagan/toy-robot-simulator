# toy-robot-simulator

This toy robot simulater is a command line Java application that simulates a robot
on a 5x5 square tabletop. 

It can read in commands of the following (textual) form:

    PLACE X,Y,F
    MOVE
    LEFT
    RIGHT
    REPORT

- PLACE will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing NORTH,
  SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
- The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the SOUTH WEST most corner.
- The first valid command to the robot is a PLACE command, after that, any
  sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE
  command. The application should discard all commands in the sequence until
  a valid PLACE command has been executed.
- MOVE will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is
  currently facing.
- LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction
  without changing the position of the robot.
- REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of the robot. This can be in any form,
  but standard output is sufficient.

- A robot that is not on the table can choose the ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT
  and REPORT commands.
- Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.
- Provide test data to exercise the application.
- The application must be a command line application.

Constraints
-----------

- The toy robot must not fall off the table during movement. This also
  includes the initial placement of the toy robot.
- Any move that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored.
